    <h1>What is this about?</h1>
    <p>
        A cowboy rides out in the morning on his horse, and returns in the evening. 
    </p>
    <p>
        return.horse is an experimental webcomic. 
        It's built upon many of the standard webcomic conventions that I love.

        Some of the things I'm trying to explore are: 
        <ol>
            <li>creative repetition</li>
            <li>lowering the bar for creating something</li>
            <li>the webcomic process </li>
            <li>the ontological nature of a webcomic </li>
        </ol>

        Ultimately I made this because I thought it would be funny. The rest kind of followed from that.

            It is possible that God says every morning, “Do it again” to the sun; and every evening, “Do
            it again” to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it
            may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them. -
